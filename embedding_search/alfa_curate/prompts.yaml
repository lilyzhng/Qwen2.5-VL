# Scenario-based active learning configuration
# Each item defines a driving scenario query and optional selection parameters.

scenarios:
  - prompt: "pedestrians crossing street"
    threshold: 0.20   # minimum similarity (0.0-1.0) to keep a slice
    top_k: 200        # how many nearest neighbours to retrieve per prompt
    scoring_mode: "softmax"  # optional: "independent" or "softmax" (defaults to global config if not set)

  - prompt: "vehicle turning at an intersection"
    threshold: 0.20
    top_k: 200
    scoring_mode: "softmax"

  - prompt: "motorcyclist near ego vehicle at night"
    threshold: 0.20
    top_k: 200
    scoring_mode: "softmax"  # this prompt will use softmax mode even if others use independent

  - prompt: "camera obstruction at daytime"
    threshold: 0.20
    top_k: 200
    scoring_mode: "independent"  # this prompt will use softmax mode even if others use independent
